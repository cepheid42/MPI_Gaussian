gauss_external_input.c: 
The program takes one parameter as the input matrix.  

Six matrices (extracted from real-world problems) are available 
for your testing: (in matrices_dense subfolder)
    jpwh_991.dat	(size:   991)
    orsreg_1.dat     (size:  2205)
    sherman5.dat	(size:  3312)
    saylr4.dat	(size:  3564)
    sherman3.dat	(size:  5005)
    memplus.dat      (size: 17758)
However, I believe memplus.dat is too large so you probably
shouldn't try.

An additional artificially generated dense matrix is also availble
for your testing:
    /u/cs458/apps/gauss/seq/matrices_dense/matrix_2000.dat
    Additional matrices can be generated using matrix_gen in
    matrix_dense folder. Usage: ./matrix_gen <size> >> newfile.dat

gauss_internal_input.c:

Takes matrix size as input and generates the matrix internally. 
Usage: ./gauss_internal_input -s <matrix size>
